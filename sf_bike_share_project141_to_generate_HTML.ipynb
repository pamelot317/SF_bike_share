    "The Bay Area Bike Share is the region’s bike sharing system with 700 bikes and 70 stations across the region, with locations in San Francisco, San Jose, Mountain View, and Palo Alto. A bike sharing system consists of a fleet of specially designed bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations located throughout a region. Bay Area bikes can be rented from and returned to any station in the system, creating an efficient network with many possible combinations of start and end points. With hundreds of bikes at stations, the system is available for use 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The station network provides twice as many docking points as bicycles, assuring that an available dock to return your bike is always nearby.\n",

Clicking on each marker brings a pop-up with the station name, number of trips as starting point from that station in 2016, and the total dockcounts.\n",

    "The reason that the number of bike rides and total riding is decreasing from 2013 to 2016 is that the company removed stations that are used less frequently and pulled out from the Redwood City market at the end of 2015.

Not many people get both of those days off, so it is starting to look like a lot of the people using the bike share are using during normal business and commuting times. This suggests that the primary customers are residents and not tourists. We will learn more with further analysis."

It seems reasonable that a commute for work wouldn’t take more than 15 minutes in San Francisco, especially with the prevalence of bart and caltrain stations throughout the city.

    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, the San Francisco bike sharing dominates the trip counts by cities with about 92% of total trips in 2016. Also, notice that the Redwood City had the least proportion of trips both in 2014 and 2015 which made the company to remove the all bike stations in that city. Moreover, Palo Alto and Mountain View comprise about 3-4 % of total rides. The company may have to change their business model in those cities or remove stations in the future, and concentrate on San Francisco and San Jose markets. Palo Alto and Mountain View have technology companies which provide their workers with free bikes and shuttle to commit. Hence, it does not make sense to target those two markets with bike sharing business. Instead, as we will see, there are some stations in San Francisco which desperately require more bikes and docks, and the company could focus on those parts of the city. Instead of trying to cover all Bay Area, the company could focus on growing in San Francisco and San Jose, and in East Bay. With the proposed expansion plan, that’s exactly what they are trying to do by the end of 2018."

    "Daily average counts of available bikes and docks in San Francisco clearly shows that starting from night to around 5:00 - 6:00 am the counts of bikes and docks are almost constant. This is probably because very few people use bike sharing at nights. Starting from 5:00 - 6:00 am, less bikes and more docks become available. At 8:30 am the least number of bikes are available, and most docks are free. This clearly shows that in San Francisco, most people use bike sharing as a way to commute to their work. Later, after 10, more bikes become avaialbe till around 3:00 pm. As expected, the counts of free bikes and busy docks start to decrease from 3:00 pm, and at 5:30 pm the one might not be able to find a bike on a nearby bike share station. This again proves that most customers use bike riding to commute back home or nearby Caltrain, bart, or bus stations.\n",

    "For San Jose, this pattern is not clear but closer look might tell similar story. However, since San Jose comprises only about 5% of total bike rides in 2016, this data might be not sufficient to reveal any patterns yet.

Both two stations are close to Ferry Building which is a destination for tourists and a center of transit hub that connects San Francisco’s neighborhoods and the surrounding bay area communities. Also, 2nd at Townsend station ranked fourth in the list is in the proximity of MUNI station. Therefore, top five bike stations are adjacent to public transit stations that people normally use to commute to their works or places of interest where tourists visit.\n",

On the other hand, San Francisco City Hall station with the least number of rides (2195) among all stations has 19 bikes. This shows that the number of bikes available for high demand stations is not proportional to the number of trips. Therefore, this will cause in empty bike docks and longer waiting time that eventually leads to user dissatisfaction. It is highly recommended to increase the number of bikes in these stations or install new stations near the existing ones to optimize the serviceability and waiting time.\n",

Broadway St at Batter St station was installed in late 2014 which explains the low ride rate. However, San Francisco Caltrain 2 (230 Townsend) has the same installation date as San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend at 4th) with more dock counts and much less ride counts in 2014. No significant observation found to explain the low ride rate for this station in 2014 and the following significant jump in 2015. "

    "The plots below show the availability fo bikes and docks throughout a day for the two busiest staions: Townsend at 4th and 330 Townsend. One can see that the number of available bikes reaches peak at midnight and at around 6:00am - 7:00am in the morning starts to decline. Meanwhile, the number of available docks is least during night since bikes are docked. Again, starting from 6:00am - 7:00am more docks become available. Hence, between 6:00am - 7:00am availability of bikes and docks change. It must be due to the fact that there is Caltrain station and it is the last line coming to San Francisco Downtown business area. And as stated above, most people probably use Bay Area Bike Share as subscribers and commute via bike to their work. Around 4:00-6:00pm pm they return back to Caltrain to go home and at the same time the number of available bikes starts to increase while docks become less available. Surprisingly, both bike share stations have the same pattern. Moreover, for all three years this pattern is preserved. Hence, it might a good idea to invest more into locations that have Caltrain or BART stations and promote people to use bike sharing as a \"last mile connection\"."

On Saturday and Sunday, even less bikes are used and hence less number of docks are available. This pattern is similar for all three years, and for both stations. This means that the majority of bike share systems users are the ones that work in San Francisco and commute with Caltrain. It might also explain the fact that almost 92% of users are subscribers. Hence, people tend to subscribe for yearly bike sharing and use bikes to fill the last gap in their commute."

    "The bike riding pattern plots according month for Townsend at 4th and 330 Townsend show that the average number of bikes and docks is almost constant between February and October. This is expected since those months are usually warm and have suitable weather for bike riding. During winter months, people tend to use bikes less and hence more bikes and less docks are available. Again, the pattern is similar for all three years, and for both stations. Also, during December and January, there is Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, and holidays. Hence, less people work which might also explain less usage of bikes in those months. That period of time could be used to do bike condition check ups, repairs, etc. "

    "In this section, we would like to explore whether crimes and income distribution in San Francisco were influencing factors in choosing the current bike stations. The crime data is provided by City of San Francisco and is published on <a href = 'http://sfgov.org'> SFGOV </a> The dataset contains various crimes from 2003 to 2016. Among different types of crimes available in the dataset, crimes that are more relevant to bikes or may endanger the bikers were picked. The selected crimes were as follows: burglary, driving under influence, rubbery, stolen property, vandalism, and vehicle theft. Also, the analysis is focused only on crimes taken place in 2016. The following plot shows the distribution of crimes as red dots on San Francisco map. This is an interactive map, hovering the mouse over the points will show the type of crime. It could be seen that the crime points are all over the map with much higher density in downtown where the bike stations are located. Therefore, there is no significant relationship between the station locations and crime distribution in the city. "

The locations that met these criteria are mostly located in downtown and vicinity where all the bike stations are located at this moment. "

    "First, we assume that the two busiest stations near Caltrain station in the San Francisco Downtown area should be expanded by including more bikes and docks. As we have seen, the majority of customers use those two locations for everyday commute to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the Caltrain line on 22nd street has no nearby bike station. The closest bike station at Townsend 7th had about 12000 bike trips as a starting point as can be seen from the first map we provided. Moreover, close to 22nd street there are business areas such Mission Bay, etc. Hence, it might be a good idea to invest in that location also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, local San Francisco people and the ones who commute from EAST BAY tend to use BART, and it would be a good idea to invest in parts of San Francisco that have BART stations. Especially, Market St. and Dolores St. that have BART lines connecting West and South parts of San Francisco to the Downtown could be targeted for bike share station locations. Similar to Caltrain stations, subscribers would commute to work everyday via bike sharing. This would help to avoid using cars, taxis, or uber, to fill the \"last mile\" in their commute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, since we could not find any relations between income and crime map with the location of bike stations, we would argue that parts of San Francisco that have many offices but considered dangerous could also be targeted (Turk St. example). Also, the west parts of San Francisco that allure high number of tourists due to national parks (Golden Gate, e.g.) or beaches, could also be a target to expand the business in the San Francisco. However, it should not be a priority during expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, as the data show, during winter and holidays, people tend to use less bike sharing. Therefore, those periods of time could be a suitable for repairing, re-installing new docks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the data reveals a clear pattern of bike share usage and definitely helps during the expansion project to find the right locations for new stations."
